# Nicks Handmade Boots Fitting Chart

This repo and its contents are _not official Nicks materials_.  For the latest, official word on sizing and fitting, see <https://nicksboots.com/>.

I put this repo together after seeing an old Nicks fitting chart shared in image form on Reddit a number of times.  I wanted to verify that the measurement increments between length and width sizes were indeed linear---changing by a fixed amount between each size.  I also wanted a table I could post into Reddit comment, which I did [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NicksHandmadeBoots/comments/1cc3dwh/i_digitized_nicks_sizing_table/l2n9795/).
